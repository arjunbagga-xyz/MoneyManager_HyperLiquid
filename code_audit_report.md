# Code Audit Report

## Introduction

This report provides a comprehensive audit of the trading platform, covering its frontend, backend, and overall architecture. The audit focuses on identifying incomplete features, ensuring compliance with the Hyperliquid API, and suggesting potential improvements and new features. The report is structured by the main pages/features of the application as they appear in the frontend.

## Dashboard Page

The Dashboard is the main landing page for authenticated users. It provides an overview of their managed wallets, open orders, and current positions.

### 1. Wallets

**Completeness:**
- The current implementation allows users to add wallets by providing a name and private key.
- It displays the wallet's address and balance.
- This is a good start, but lacks many features available in the Hyperliquid UI and API.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Missing Historical Data:** The Hyperliquid API provides endpoints to retrieve historical fills (`userFills`) and historical orders (`historicalOrders`). This data should be displayed on the dashboard to give users a complete picture of their trading activity.
- **Portfolio Value:** The API (`portfolio` endpoint) can return historical portfolio values. This would be a great addition to the dashboard, allowing users to track their performance over time with a chart.
- **Subaccounts:** The API supports the creation and management of subaccounts (`subAccounts` endpoint). This is a key feature of the Hyperliquid platform that is not currently implemented.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **Wallet Import/Export:** Allow users to import and export their wallet configurations for easier backup and migration.
- **Multi-Wallet View:** Provide a consolidated view of all wallets, showing the total balance and a combined list of orders and positions.

### 2. Open Orders

**Completeness:**
- The dashboard currently displays a list of open orders for a selected wallet.
- This is a basic implementation that meets the minimum requirements.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Real-time Updates:** The UI for open orders does not update in real-time. The `websocket` API should be used to stream order updates to the frontend, ensuring that the displayed information is always current.
- **More Order Details:** The `frontendOpenOrders` info endpoint provides more detailed information about open orders, such as whether they are trigger orders, take-profit/stop-loss (TP/SL) orders, or reduce-only. This information should be displayed to the user.
- **Cancel Orders:** The `exchange` endpoint allows for canceling orders. This functionality should be added to the open orders list, allowing users to cancel orders directly from the dashboard.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **Batch Cancel:** Implement a "Cancel All" button to allow users to quickly cancel all open orders for a given wallet.
- **Order Notifications:** Provide browser notifications when an order is filled or canceled.

### 3. Positions

**Completeness:**
- The dashboard displays a list of open positions for a selected wallet.
- Similar to open orders, this is a basic but functional implementation.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Real-time P&L:** The P&L (Profit & Loss) for positions is likely not updating in real-time. The `websocket` should be used to stream position updates and calculate real-time P&L.
- **Leverage and Margin:** The `updateLeverage` and `updateIsolatedMargin` actions in the `exchange` endpoint allow users to manage their leverage and margin. This is a critical feature for a trading platform that is currently missing.
- **Close Positions:** The `exchange` endpoint allows for closing positions by placing an opposing order. A "Close" button should be added to each position to simplify this process.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **Position Charting:** Display a chart showing the entry price and the current price of the asset for each position.
- **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share their position P&L on social media.

## Trading Page

The Trading Page is where users can manually place orders.

**Completeness:**
- The page provides a basic interface for placing limit and market orders.
- It also displays open orders and positions, similar to the dashboard.
- The functionality is minimal and does not reflect the full capabilities of the Hyperliquid exchange.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Advanced Order Types:** The `exchange` endpoint supports a variety of order types, including trigger orders (take-profit and stop-loss), and time-in-force options (ALO, IOC). These should be added to the order form to give users more control over their trades.
- **Order Modification:** The API allows for modifying existing orders (`modify` action). This is a key feature that is currently missing. Users should be able to modify the price and size of their open orders.
- **Client Order ID (cloid):** The `order` action allows for a client-specified order ID (`cloid`). This is useful for preventing duplicate orders and for tracking orders within the client. The application should generate and use `cloids`.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **TradingView Charting:** Integrate the TradingView charting library to provide users with a professional-grade charting experience.
- **Depth Chart:** Display a real-time depth chart to help users visualize the order book.
- **Click-to-Trade:** Allow users to click on the order book or chart to automatically populate the price in the order form.

## Bot Lab Page

The Bot Lab allows users to create, manage, and run custom automated trading bots.

**Completeness:**
- Users can create bots with Python code and a JSON schema for inputs.
- Bots can be run with a specified wallet and capital allocation.
- The bot runner uses `multiprocessing` for isolation and a `WebSocketListener` for real-time fills, which is a solid foundation.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Leverage in Bots:** The `BotTradingAPI` does not seem to account for leverage. The bot's `CapitalManager` should be enhanced to allow bots to specify and use leverage, and the `updateLeverage` action should be exposed to them.
- **Access to Info Endpoints:** Bots currently have a limited `BotTradingAPI`. They should be given access to the `info` endpoint to allow them to query for data like historical fills, open orders, and market data, which would enable more sophisticated strategies.
- **Real-time Order Book:** The `WebSocket` can stream `l2Book` data. This should be made available to bots to allow them to perform order book analysis and make more informed trading decisions.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **Backtesting Engine:** A backtesting engine would be a massive improvement. It would allow users to test their bot strategies against historical data before risking real capital.
- **Bot Marketplace:** Create a marketplace where users can share and subscribe to each other's trading bots.
- **More Languages:** While Python is a great start, supporting other languages like JavaScript (via Node.js) or Rust could attract a wider range of developers.

## Vaults Page

The Vaults Page is intended for users to deposit funds into Hyperliquid's vaults to earn a return.

**Completeness:**
- The `architecture.md` and `api.md` state that depositing into vaults is supported, but withdrawing is not. This is a critical missing piece of functionality.
- The frontend is very basic and only lists vaults.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Implement Withdrawals:** The `vaultTransfer` action in the `exchange` endpoint supports both deposits and withdrawals (`isDeposit`: `false`). The backend and frontend need to be updated to support withdrawals.
- **Display Vault Details:** The `vaultDetails` query in the `info` endpoint provides a wealth of information about vaults, including their name, description, performance, and follower stats. This information should be displayed to the user to help them make informed decisions about where to deposit their funds.
- **User's Vault Equity:** The `userVaultEquities` query in the `info` endpoint shows a user's deposits in various vaults. This should be displayed on the vaults page so users can see where their funds are and how they are performing.

**Suggestions (Big Picture):**
- **Vault Leaderboard:** Create a leaderboard of the top-performing vaults to help users discover the best opportunities.
- **Simplified Vault Creation:** While the Hyperliquid UI is the primary way to create vaults, a simplified vault creation interface within the platform could be a powerful feature for advanced users.

## Account Page

The Account Page handles user registration, login, and logout.

**Completeness:**
- The current implementation is a standard and complete username/password authentication system.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **API Keys:** The Hyperliquid API supports API keys (`approveAgent` action). The platform should allow users to create and manage API keys for programmatic access to their accounts. This would be a significant feature for advanced traders and developers.

**Suggestions (Big-Picture):**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** For enhanced security, implement 2FA using a standard like TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password).
- **Social Logins:** Allow users to register and log in using their Google, GitHub, or other social accounts for convenience.

## General Architecture

**Completeness:**
- The overall architecture is well-designed, with a clear separation of concerns between the frontend, backend, and database.
- The use of FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and a modular structure is a solid foundation.

**API Compliance & Suggestions (SDK):**
- **Staking:** The `api.md` and `user_guide.md` mention a "Staking" page and API endpoints, but there is no `staking.html` in the frontend. The Hyperliquid API has extensive support for staking (`cDeposit`, `cWithdraw`, `tokenDelegate`). This feature should be properly implemented or removed to avoid confusion. *Correction*: The memory mentions the Staking feature was removed. The documentation should be updated to reflect this. I will make a note to do this.
- **Error Handling:** The backend should provide more informative error messages to the frontend. The Hyperliquid API returns detailed error messages that should be parsed and passed on to the user.

**Suggestions (Big-Picture):**
- **Testing:** The backend has a `tests` directory, but the extent of the test coverage is unknown. A comprehensive test suite is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the platform. I will investigate the tests more deeply in a future step.
- **Configuration Management:** The use of a `.env` file is good, but for a production system, a more robust solution like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager should be considered for managing sensitive information.
