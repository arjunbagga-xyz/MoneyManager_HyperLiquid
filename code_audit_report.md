# Code Audit Report

This document details the findings of a comprehensive code audit of the Hyperliquid trading platform, cross-referencing the implementation with the official Hyperliquid documentation.

## 1. Staking

### 1.1. Implemented Features

-   `GET /validators`: Fetches the list of validators.
-   `POST /delegate`: Delegates HYPE to a validator.
-   `POST /undelegate`: Undelegates HYPE from a validator.

### 1.2. Discrepancies and Missing Features

-   **Unstaking Queue:** The documentation specifies a 7-day unstaking queue when transferring HYPE from a staking account to a spot account. The current `/undelegate` endpoint appears to be a synchronous operation, which might be misleading for the user. The API should reflect the asynchronous nature of this process.
-   **Staking Rewards:** The documentation details how staking rewards are calculated, accrued, and distributed. There are no endpoints to check reward balances or history.
-   **Validator Status:** The documentation mentions that validators can be "jailed," which affects their ability to earn rewards. The `/validators` endpoint should ideally include the status of each validator.
-   **Account Abstraction:** The docs distinguish between "spot" and "staking" accounts. The current implementation does not make this distinction clear in its API.

## 2. Vaults

### 2.1. Implemented Features

-   `GET /meta`: Fetches metadata about vaults.
-   `POST /deposit`: Deposits funds into a vault.

### 2.2. Discrepancies and Missing Features

-   **Withdraw Functionality:** The most critical missing feature is the ability to withdraw funds from a vault. This makes the entire vault feature non-functional from a user's perspective.
-   **Profit Sharing:** The documentation describes a 10% profit-sharing mechanism for vault owners. This is not implemented.
-   **Vault Types:** The documentation mentions "protocol vaults" which have no fees. The current API does not distinguish between different vault types.
-   **Vault Management:** There are no endpoints for vault owners to manage their vaults (e.g., set strategy, close vault).
-   **Performance History:** The docs mention that users should assess the performance history of a vault before depositing. There are no endpoints to retrieve this data.

## 3. Trading

### 3.1. Implemented Features

-   `POST /`: Places a new order.

### 3.2. Discrepancies and Missing Features

-   **Order Management:**
    -   `cancel`: No endpoint to cancel an existing order by its ID.
    -   `cancelByCloid`: No endpoint to cancel an order by its client-provided ID.
    -   `modify`: No endpoint to modify an existing order.
    -   `batchModify`: No endpoint to modify multiple orders at once.
-   **Position Management:**
    -   `updateLeverage`: No endpoint to change the leverage for a specific asset.
    -   `updateIsolatedMargin`: No endpoint to add or remove margin from an isolated position.
-   **Information Retrieval:** While the `info` endpoint in the Hyperliquid API provides a lot of data, our backend doesn't expose any of it. Key missing endpoints include:
    -   Querying open orders.
    -   Querying order status.
    -   Querying trade fills.
    -   Querying the user's overall state (positions, margin, etc.).
-   **Advanced Order Types:**
    -   `twapOrder`: No support for placing Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) orders.
    -   `scheduleCancel`: No support for the "dead man's switch" feature to cancel all orders at a future time.
-   **Transfers:**
    -   The API allows for various types of transfers (USDC, Spot, between accounts) that are not exposed in our application.

## 4. Custom Bots

### 4.1. Implemented Features

-   `POST /`: Create a new bot.
-   `GET /`: List all bots for the current user.
-   `POST /{bot_id}/run`: Run a specific bot.
-   `POST /{bot_id}/stop`: Stop a running bot.
-   `GET /{bot_id}/logs`: Retrieve logs for a specific bot.

### 4.2. Missing Features and Potential Improvements

-   **Status Endpoint:** There is no endpoint to check the current status of a bot (e.g., running, stopped, errored). This makes it difficult for a user to know if their bot is functioning correctly.
-   **Performance Tracking:** The platform does not track the performance of bots. Key metrics like PnL, number of trades, and win rate would be highly valuable.
-   **Backtesting:** A crucial feature for any bot platform is the ability to backtest a strategy against historical data. This is completely missing.
-   **Bot Code Management:**
    -   `PUT /{bot_id}`: No endpoint to update the code of an existing bot.
    -   `DELETE /{bot_id}`: No endpoint to delete a bot.
-   **Log Management:** The current log implementation is very basic. A more robust logging system would include log rotation, different log levels (info, warning, error), and the ability to clear logs.
-   **Security:** The bot code is executed directly on the server. This is a significant security risk, as a malicious bot could potentially compromise the entire system. The bot code should be sandboxed to prevent this.
-   **Secret Management:** The `runtime_inputs` are passed as plain text. This is not secure for sensitive data like API keys or other secrets. A proper secret management system should be integrated.

## 5. User Management

### 5.1. Implemented Features

-   `POST /token`: User login and JWT token generation.
-   `POST /`: User registration.
-   `GET /me`: Fetches the current user's details.

### 5.2. Missing Features and Potential Improvements

-   **User Profile Management:** No endpoints to update user information (e.g., change password, update email).
-   **Password Reset:** No functionality for users to reset a forgotten password.
-   **User Deactivation/Deletion:** No way for a user to deactivate or delete their account.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The system does not appear to have any concept of user roles (e.g., admin, user). This would be important for future administrative features.

## 6. Wallet Management

### 6.1. Implemented Features

-   `POST /`: Create a new wallet.
-   `GET /`: List all wallets for the current user.
-   `GET /{wallet_address}/balance`: Get the balance of a wallet.
-   `GET /{wallet_id}/open-orders`: Get open orders for a wallet.
-   `GET /{wallet_id}/positions`: Get positions for a wallet.

### 6.2. Missing Features and Potential Improvements

-   **Wallet Deletion:** No endpoint to delete a wallet.
-   **Wallet Nicknames/Labels:** Users can't assign a custom name to a wallet, which would improve usability.
-   **Transaction History:** No endpoint to retrieve the transaction history for a wallet.
-   **Comprehensive User State:** The `get_user_state` method from the Hyperliquid API provides a wealth of information (margin summary, asset positions, etc.). The current implementation only exposes a fraction of this data.
-   **Private Key Security:** Private keys are stored in the database. While this is necessary for the bot functionality, they should be encrypted at rest to improve security.

## 7. Manual Verification

Due to persistent issues with the test environment, the following endpoints were manually verified using `curl`:

-   `POST /users/`: User creation was successful.
-   `POST /users/token`: User login and JWT token generation were successful.
-   `GET /staking/validators`: After fixing an `AttributeError` in the `get_validators` method, this endpoint now successfully returns a list of assets from the Hyperliquid API.

## 8. Suggestions for New Features

Based on the Hyperliquid documentation, the following new features could be added to the platform:

-   **Spot Trading:** The Hyperliquid API supports spot trading, which is currently not implemented in the application. Adding this would significantly expand the platform's capabilities.
-   **Subaccounts:** The API allows for the creation and management of subaccounts. This would be a valuable feature for users who want to isolate different trading strategies or manage funds for multiple people.
-   **API Wallets:** The concept of "API Wallets" (or "Agent Wallets") in the Hyperliquid documentation could be integrated to provide more secure and flexible API key management.
-   **Websockets:** The Hyperliquid API provides a websocket interface for real-time data feeds. This could be used to provide users with live updates on their positions, orders, and market data.
-   **Bridge Integration:** The platform could integrate with the Hyperliquid bridge to allow users to deposit and withdraw funds directly from the application.
-   **Referrals:** The Hyperliquid API has a referral program. This could be integrated into the platform to incentivize user growth.
-   **Points:** The API also has a points system, which could be used to gamify the trading experience and reward active users.
