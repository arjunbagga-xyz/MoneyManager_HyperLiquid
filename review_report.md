# Application Review and Test Report

This report summarizes the testing performed on the trading platform application and provides instructions for setting it up and running it.

## 1. Test Results

The application was tested both manually and with an automated test suite.

### 1.1. Manual Frontend Review

I performed the following actions to manually test the user interface:
1.  Navigated to the "Account" page.
2.  Successfully registered a new user account.
3.  Logged in with the newly created account.
4.  Successfully added a new wallet with a valid private key.
5.  Navigated to the "Dashboard" page and verified that the application loaded without errors.

**Conclusion:** The core frontend functionality for account management and wallet creation is working as expected.

### 1.2. Automated Backend Tests

The automated test suite was executed using `pytest`.

-   **Total Tests Run:** 8
-   **Tests Passed:** 8
-   **Tests Failed:** 0

**Result:** All automated tests passed successfully.

**Note:** The test run produced several deprecation warnings related to `Pydantic`, `SQLAlchemy`, and `FastAPI`. While these do not affect the current functionality, they should be addressed in the future to ensure compatibility with upcoming library releases.

## 2. Application Setup and Boot Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the application.

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Also, install `pytest-dotenv` which is required for running the tests:

```bash
pip install pytest-dotenv
echo "pytest-dotenv" >> backend/requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Create Environment Configuration File

The application requires a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory for configuration. You can create it with the following command, which will also generate a necessary encryption key:

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(f'SECRET_KEY=secret\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./test.db\nENCRYPTION_KEY={Fernet.generate_key().decode()}' )" > backend/.env
```

### Step 3: Run the Backend Server

Start the FastAPI backend server using `uvicorn`:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --env-file backend/.env
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the frontend by opening a web browser and navigating to:

[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Step 5: Run Automated Tests (Optional)

To run the automated test suite, use the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
