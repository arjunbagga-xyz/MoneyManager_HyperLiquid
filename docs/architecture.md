# Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the trading platform.

## Backend

The backend is built using Python with the **FastAPI** framework. FastAPI was chosen for its high performance, ease of use, and automatic interactive documentation generation.

## Frontend

The frontend is a simple web interface built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This approach was chosen for its simplicity and to ensure the application is accessible from both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Database

The database is a **PostgreSQL** relational database. PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness, reliability, and powerful features that are well-suited for financial applications. We will use the **SQLAlchemy** ORM to interact with the database.
